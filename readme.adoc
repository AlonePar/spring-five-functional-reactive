= Spring 5 - Functional, reactive web example

This repository contains the sample code for Spring WebFlux's functional web API and consists of the following building blocks:

1. A `User` domain type and a reactive repository mapped using Spring Data MongoDB.
2. A `FunctionalWebController` to contain handler functions.
3. An `@Bean`-Definition for a `RouterFunction` that uses the functional API to configure the mappings of requests to the `FunctionalWebController`.

== How to run the sample

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/olivergierke/spring-five-functional-reactive
$ cd spring-five-functional-reactive
$ ./mvnw spring-boot:run
$ curl http://localhost:8080/users
